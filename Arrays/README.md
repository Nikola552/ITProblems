Here are all my solutions to all array related problems. Hope this fill come handy

What is an array in programming:

An array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. Depending on the language, array types may overlap (or be identified with) other data types that describe aggregates of values, such as lists and strings.
