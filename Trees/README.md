These are tree related problems and my solutions.

What is a tree in programming?
 - A tree is a collection of nodes connected by directed (or undirected) edges. A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures.

 Why are they used?
 - Trees are commonly used to represent or manipulate hierarchical data in applications such as: File systems for: Directory structure used to organize subdirectories and files (symbolic links create non-tree graphs, as do multiple hard links to the same file or directory)
