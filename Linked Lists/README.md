All of my solutons realted with Linked lists.

To better understand what are linked lists:
- Just like a garland is made with flowers, a linked list is made up of nodes. We call every flower on this particular garland to be a node. And each of the node points to the next node in this list as well as it has data (here it is type of flower).
